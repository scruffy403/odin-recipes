        until tripe is tender but firm ( make sure you do not overcook).For the
        INSTANT POT, cook for 30 minutes, for a Pressure cooker 45 minutes. You
        could also use a slow cooker and set it on low for 6 hrs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cow feet and marrow bones from the pot. Skim the fat that
        forms on top of the broth. Once the Cow foot cools a litte, remove the
        bones and chop the meaty parts off to be returned to the pot.

        While the meat is cooking, prepare the guajillo sauce. Toas the Guajillo
        peppers in a griddle over medium heat. Press them down with a spatula
        slightly toasting them without burnign them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the roasted peppers ina bown and cover with water. Let them soak
        for about 25 minutes until soft. After taht, drain the peppers and place
        them in your blender with the rest of the garlic, 1.2 cup of the broth,
        and cumin if using. Blent until very smooth. Straing the sauce using a
        sieve and pour into the pot. Simmer the broth for another 30 minutes,

      Some people add Hominy to the soup. If you can buy Hominy in a can, drain
      it and add it to the soup in the final simmering.
